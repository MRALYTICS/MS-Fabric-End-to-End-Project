# MS-Fabric-End-to-End-Project
# PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
Stroke Prediction: In this project, we will predict whether a patient will have a heart stroke or not based on his/her comorbidities, work, and lifestyle. The project requires Data ingestion and orchestration, Data Cleaning, Data Visualiation and Machine learning Model(SVM). The following Microsoft Fabric workload were used for the project delivery:

1. Data Engineering(Data Factory & Synpase Engineering)
2. Data Science
3. Data Analysis(Power BI)
